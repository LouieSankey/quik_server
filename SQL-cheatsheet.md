# postgres CLI
 login into the console. 
`sudo su - postgres`

`pg_ctl start`
YOU NEED THIS RUNNING IN BACKGROUND 
OTHERWISE YOU'LL GET:

<!-- `Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
    at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1134:16) {
  errno: 'ECONNREFUSED',
  code: 'ECONNREFUSED',
  syscall: 'connect',
  address: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 5432` -->

Enter the PostgreSQL console with:
`psql`

Stop Server wtih
`pg_ctl stop`

If you see this prompt you're in: `postgres=#`

# Interacting with the DB from inside postgres

To create a new database from inside postgres
`CREATE DATABASE db_name;`

Or from the terminal, outside postgres=# 
(note: sometimes it won't show up right away with \l but you can still connect)
`createdb my_test_db_name`

To list all the databases in the server:
`\l`, `\list`

To delete a database (warning zone):
`DROP DATABASE db_name;`

To connect to a database run:
`\c db_name`, `\connect db_name`

and you should see:
You are now connected to database "family" as user "postgres"

# Interacting with tables
Once connected to a database you can list all its tables with:
`\dt`

This command will give you a representation of all the tables in the database:

          List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  |  Owner   
--------+----------+-------+----------
 public | daughter | table | postgres
 public | mother   | table | postgres
(2 rows)


To see its columns, run:
`\d table_name`

This command will give you a complete description of the table:

                                      Table "public.daughter"
   Column   |          Type          | Collation | Nullable |               Default                
------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------------------------------
 id         | smallint               |           | not null | nextval('daughter_id_seq'::regclass)
 first_name | character varying(254) |           | not null | 
 last_name  | character varying(254) |           | not null | 
 mother_id  | integer                |           | not null | 
Indexes:
    "daughter_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "fk_mother_id" FOREIGN KEY (mother_id) REFERENCES mother(id)


You can see every column in the table with the corresponding type. If there is any primary or foreign key you'll see them as well.

# Roles
Database users can interact, modify, update, and see databases. In PostgreSQL they're called roles. To create a new user from the PostgreSQL console run:
`CREATE ROLE my_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'my_password';`

List roles with 
`\du`

Drop role with 
postgres=# `DROP ROLE name`, or from terminal `dropuser name`

PostgreSQL roles may own one or more database. Once you create a role you can assign an entire database to it:

`CREATE DATABASE my_database WITH OWNER my_user;`
When you're done with databases, roles, and tables you can finally exit the console with:
`\q`

# Scripts
Fill (seed) an already made db with tables (or drop them) by running from
TERMINAL
`psql -U username -d db_name -f ./sql-script.sql`

edit, copy and past this in:
`psql -U postgres -d quik -f ./seeds/seeds.pins.sql`
`psql -U postgres -d bookmarks_test -f ./seeds/seeds.bookmarks.sql`

psql -U postgres -d quik -f ./migrations/002.undo.create_pin_table.sql

In a script.sql use keyword BEGIN; and COMMIT; to wrap multiple scripts you want
treated as one
